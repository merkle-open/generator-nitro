# Yeoman Nitro Generator

> Yeoman generator for Nitro - lets you quickly set up a frontend project with sensible defaults and best practices.

Nitro is a Node.js application for simple and complex frontend development with a tiny footprint.  
It provides a proven but flexible structure to develop your frontend code, even in a large team.  
Keep track of your code with a modularized frontend. This app and the suggested
[atomic design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) and [BEM](https://en.bem.info/method/definitions/)
concepts could help.  
Nitro is simple, fast and flexible. It works on macOS, Windows and Linux. Use this app for all your frontend work.

## Usage

Before using, you need of course [node](https://nodejs.org/) installed.  
Nitro and the Nitro generator are tested with the current LTS versions of the node.js releases 4 and 6.
(So everything between should work). They should also work with node.js release 8.

Install `yarn`, `yo` and `generator-nitro` globally:

    npm install -g yarn yo generator-nitro

Keep your global packages up to date:

    npm outdated -g --depth=0

Do an update if necessary:

    npm update -g

## Project Generation

Create a new directory, and `cd` into it:

    mkdir my-new-project && cd $_

Run:

    yo nitro

You will be guided through some configuration options:

* Desired Name (default: current directory name)
* Desired CSS preprocessor (`less` or `scss`; default: `less`)
* Desired view file extension (`html`, `hbs` or `mustache`; default: `html`)
* Using client side templates (default: false)
* Including example code (default: true)
* Installing [`nitro-exporter`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nitro-exporter) (default: false)
* Installing [`nitro-release`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nitro-release) (default: false)

The choosen options will be stored for the next project generation.

It's possible to pass in these options through the command line:

    yo nitro --name=myproject --pre=less --viewExt=hbs --clientTpl

### Update a project

If you run `yo nitro` from an existing project you may update your project to a newer version.

## Generators

Available generators:

* `yo nitro` (aka `yo nitro:app`)
* `yo nitro:pattern [name]`

Note: Generators are to be run from the root directory of your project.

## Generated app

See how tho use the [generated app](generators/app/templates/project/docs/nitro.md)

## Testing

Running `yarn test` will run the `jasmine` unit tests.

    yarn test
