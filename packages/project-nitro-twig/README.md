# Nitro Test Twig

Project to test generated Nitro project

## Usage

Before using, you need of course [node](https://nodejs.org/) installed.  
Ensure correct [node-version](./.node-version)

We use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) as package manager because it's much faster than npm.

Run:

```
yarn install
```

and start in development mode

```
yarn start
```
