# proto

Place non productive code in the corresponding subfolders of this directory. 
Use this for all your development code which never should be on production.

CSS and JavaScript files here are builded with webpack. 
Files placed in the folder `proto` of each pattern are also taken.

You may change the [entry point](../proto.js)
