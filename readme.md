# Nitro

Nitro is a Node.js application for simple and complex frontend development with a tiny footprint.
It provides a proven but flexible structure to develop your frontend code, even in a large team.

The codebase is split up in different packages, organized in this monorepo.
Besides the main functionality including a yeoman generator, this repo includes also example projects.
